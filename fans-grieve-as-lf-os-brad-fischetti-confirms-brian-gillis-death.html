Brad Fischetti, a former bandmate of Gillis, shared a vintage black-and-white photo of the singer on Instagram on Thursday, March 30, to confirm the <a href=#>singer's death</a>. No specific explanation of the death was provided. Gillis was 47.</p><p>Along with fellow singers Fischetti and Rich Cronin, Gillis founded the <a href=# rel>pop band</a> in 1995, which stands for 'Lyte Funkie Ones.' Their first songs included adaptations of 'If I Can't Have You' by Yvonne Elliman and 'Step by Step' by the New Kids on the Block. Singer <a href=#>Devin Lima</a> took over for Gillis, who left the band just before their self-titled debut album was released in August 1999, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'Devastating': Sharon Stone opens up about heartbreak after tragic deaths of her brother Patrick and 11-month-old nephew River</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Pierre Kartner? Musician who composed iconic 'Smurf Song' dies at 87</a></p><h2 class=split>'Struggling to process this tragic loss'</h2><p>Brad Fischetti, a <a href=#>former member</a> of LFO, posted the news of Gillis' death on both his personal Instagram account and the band's Facebook page. "Every story is made up of chapters. Some develop naturally. Some you have to cut up in your mind. The first two chapters of the LFO story lost a main character yesterday," Fischetti stated. The former LFO member admitted that he doesn't "have details" regarding Gillis' <a href=#>tragic death</a> but added, "I am really struggling to process this tragic loss."</p><p>Fischetti continued in the caption: "My relationship with Brian was complex. It contained moments of great tribulation but also of great joy. I learned a lot from him about the business of music and how to put together and rock a show. And itâ€™s those positive aspects of our relationship that I will lean on now and forever."</p><p>He added: "Iâ€™ve prayed for Brian every day for many years. And I will continue to pray for him, for his beloved father, for his friends, his family, and those who loved him. Special prayers for Pistol Pete and Terry Edwards; two men who hold a special place in my heart and undoubtedly held a special place in Brianâ€™s heart."</p><h2 class=split>'Can't believe all these losses surrounding LFO'</h2><p>Following the tragic news posted by Fischetti, fans took to social media to pay tribute to the singer. One fan commented, "Truly sorry for your loss my brother." DJ Nasty ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡º wrote, "Unbelievable! life is way too short. Brizz was so cool, straight up! Prays going out to his friends and family Your doing a excellent job keeping The LFO Legacy Alive. Keep Going!" A third fan commented, sending prayers, "RIP. Praying for his family. Thinking of you, Brad. Youâ€™ve endured so much. You are inspiring to many of us."</p><p>"Iâ€™m so sorry to hear this, Brad. I remember when Brian was with LFO and will cherish those memories - I hope you can too. Sending my best to you and the LFO family," commented another fan on the post. One more fan exclaimed, "I donâ€™t even know what to say! Iâ€™m so sorry for the continued loss you have to contend with. My heart goes out to you, his family and LFO fans." "Love you Brad. "Thank you for holding on for all of usâ€¦Brizz was amazing and itâ€™s absolutely heart breaking news to hear this. Sending my love and prayers to you and the family," typed another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/0ac1c8df-537e-4cce-ac94-23764120c52e.jpg><h2 class=split>Third LFO singer dead</h2><p>Gillis is the third member of the LFO to die; Rich Cronin, 36, who was battling leukemia, died in 2010 after suffering a stroke, and Devin Lima, 41, who sadly died from adrenal cancer in 2018. LFO was founded in 1995 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, by Gillis, Fischetti, and Cronin. LFO disbanded in 2002, but Fischetti and Lima briefly reunited in 2017, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Page Six</a>.</p><p>Throughout their time together, the band experienced many tragedies. The band split up after Cronin's death in September 2010, despite continuing to be close and embarking on a summer 2009 tour. Lima lost his battle with stage 4 cancer after a year-long battle in November 2018. Following Lima's death, Fischetti also made a statement in which he expressed his grief over losing his friend, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety</a>. In 2017, Lima and Fischetti came back together, went on tour, and recorded 'Perfect 10,' their first song in 15 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8b685347-46b7-458a-bc13-8c5dad66207f.2243677><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
