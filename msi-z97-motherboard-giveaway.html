Z97 primarily adds official support for M.2 and SATA Express, as well as RST support for PCIe storage devices. This year we'll see the transition to native PCIe/NVMe SSDs, so Z97 marks the beginning of a platform transition to a world where PCIe storage is more widespread.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7963/Chipsets_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We'll be publishing Z97 motherboard reviews over the coming days, but to kick off the launch MSI is giving AnandTech readers the chance to win one of four Z97 motherboards.
