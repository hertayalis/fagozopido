There's some who suggest that he and Mac Miller are actually related. Details ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, HBO</span></figure><p>Actor <a href=#>Angus Cloud</a> died on July 31, 2023, and his death has brought up an old theory.</p><p>The rumor is that he and musician <a href=#>Mac Miller</a> are actually related. Fans can't help but point out some striking similarities between the pair including their appearance, mannerisms, and more.</p><p>This theory began following Mac's death in 2018. When Angus was cast in <a href=#>Euphoria</a>, the show really highlighted similarities between Mac and him.</p><p>Angus played Fezco on the show and some people believe the character has a lot in common with Mac. Mainly, they cite Fezco's drug abuse (and dealing) as related to Mac's own struggle with addiction. But, is there any truth to all this speculation?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, are Angus Cloud and Mac Miller related?</h2><p>No, the pair aren't actually related. Angus denied that they were related but maintained that he had a lot of respect for Mac. While fans keep comparing their pictures, the truth has been revealed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Angus made a vow to uphold Mac's legacy.</h2><p>Since the pair look so similar, it's only natural that a casting director would consider having Angus play Mac in a biopic. However, Angus actually vowed to never do that. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ETalk</a>, "I don't think I would be prepared to take on someone's life and legacy and try to replay that, you know? That man is a legend and he's going to remain one. May he rest in peace, you feel me?"</p><p>"Taking on someone's whole life and becoming that person like, how much respect you have to give them to actually try to portray them, you know? Like, you have to learn, you know what I'm saying," he continued.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Angus Cloud die?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>Angus's cause of death hasn't been made public yet. Police responded to a call in Oakland on July 31, 2023, where they found him dead at the scene. The death came not too long after his father's funeral.</p><p>"Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend," Angus's family told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>.</p><p>"Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence," they continued.</p><p>The family said that they want to remember him for "his humor, laughter, and love for everyone."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Angus Cloud's acting history?</h2><p>Angus didn't get cast in Euphoria through traditional means. The casting director for the show happened to see Angus on the streets of New York City and thought that he would be a perfect fit. Prior to the show, he had never even acted professionally before.</p><p>Once Angus entered the world of acting, he was clearly talented. Fans adored him and eventually, he began booking other roles too.</p><p>Angus appeared in the movies North Hollywood and The Line. Prior to his death, he was working on an Untitled Universal Monsters film to be released in 2024. He was slated to appear in Freaky Tales and Your Lucky Day.</p><p>He also showed up in music videos for a variety of artists including Noah Cyrus, Juice WRLD, and Becky G.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecCnnq6rXZi5sMHDZpinnF2irqR5zKKjpZ2iYr%2BmuMCtnJ0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zotac-unveils-vr-go-20-wearable-pc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Core i7-8700T Meets GeForce GTX 1070">&larr;
