When he was 14 years old, Jack Nicklaus’ performance in the 1971 Masters caught his attention on his parent’s brand-new colour television.</p><p>Three years later, Faldo met the requirements to compete in the English Amateur in Woodhall Spa. He subsequently won his first matches in the British Youths Open Amateur Championship and the English Amateur at Royal Lytham in 1975.</p><h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Education</h3><p>Developing a love for playing golf at a young age, did Faldo go to school or he started out trying to be a professional golfer and did not give education any prominence? Let’s find out.</p><p>Nick Faldo received a golf scholarship to the University of Houston after his abilities were spotted by colleges in the United States. He stayed enrolled for a few months before quitting to focus on his career.</p><h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Career Beginnings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Untitled-design-2022-06-29T124147.012.jpg><p>Nick Faldo net worth is among the highest; he has been able to achieve this because of the career he built for himself over the years. How did he begin his professional career?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He joined the European Professional Golfers Association the following year. Faldo found quick success, placing third in 1978 and ninth in 1977 respectively in the Order of Merit.</p><p>In both years, he also triumphed in a European Tour competition, winning the Ryder Cup in 1977.</p><p>Early in the 1980s, Faldo maintained his dominance on the European Tour by winning the 1980 and 1981 Sun Alliance PGA Championships. With five victories on the European Tour, he went on to claim the 1983 Order of Merit championship.</p><p>Nick Faldo continued on to compete frequently in important tournaments. He won the Peugeot Spanish Open in May 1987, and the British Open two months later, giving him his first major victory. Two years later, at the 1989 Masters, Faldo won his second major tournament.</p><p>He then successfully defended his Masters crown in 1990. In the process, he became the first golfer since Jack Nicklaus in 1965 and 1966 to win the Masters twice.</p><p>He won his last career tournament in the Nissan Open in Los Angeles the following year. Faldo competed in his final full season on the PGA Tour in 2001 as his form was gradually deteriorating.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He continued to play less frequently, but he still managed to tie for fifth place at the 2002 US Open, which is commendable.</p><p>He finished tied for seventh at the 2003 British Open after that.
