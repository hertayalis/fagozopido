Miura's net worth was evaluated at $1.1 million, Famous People Today reported. In 1989, Miura collaborated with Yoshiyuki Okamura, a manga writer best known for creating 'Fist of the North Star', for a manga by the name of 'The King of Wolves (Ouro)'.</p><p>When Miura released the first part of 'Berserk', the manga received limited success. In 1997, he oversaw the production of 25 episodes of an anime based on 'Berserk' that aired on NTV. It was only in 2002 that the writer received an award for 'Berserk' when he received the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize of Excellence.&nbsp;</p><p>After 'Berserk', Miura worked on the Dreamcast video game 'Sword of the Berserk: Guts’ Rage', to which he made minor contributions in 1999. After that, he worked on a six-chapter mini-series called 'Gigantomakhia' in 2013. Speaking about his work, and Shojo manga, Miura said, "Shojo manga is all about expressing every feeling powerfully, and in that sense, it’s not as contrived as manga for men.”</p><p>He also said, "I had always been under the impression that a manga artist dreams up things that don’t exist in reality.” About his inspiration and how he created his work, Miura said, "There are things that I’ve consciously borrowed from, but there are also things that have sunk to the bottom of my consciousness and pop up out of nowhere later.” He also said, "Living for the future is more important than trying to avenge the past.”</p><p>Miura was a native of Chiba and began to draw manga as a boy whose works were first published in school. 'Berserk' is a story about a swordsman who is on a quest for revenge against his former master Griffith. 'Berserk' was renowned for the details in its visual storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iWwW610mainqaklr%2BwecyirKuZXaOytXnWqKmtoF2irq%2BzwGauq6Gkmr9usMiem2aZpGKCdXnCq5yarJ%2BnerCyjKucp6eno7KlecGeqaydoqA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-bupkis-based-on-pete-davidsons-life-is-the-movie-a-true-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bupkis: Peacock Series Satirizes Pete Davidsons Life">&larr;
