Holmes to win the Farmers Insurance Open in February 2015.</span><p><span>The day broke during the 2015 US Open due to dizziness.&nbsp;He was too weak to play the next day and finished the third round in 9th place.&nbsp;After recovering, Jason Day continued his winning streak and became the #1 Barclays and BMW Championships on September 20, 2015.&nbsp;on September 13, 2017.</span></p><p><span>In January 2018, he went home with the Farmer Insurance Open title for the second time in his career after beating Ryan Palmer by sudden death in the play-offs.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day was Forbes’ Richest Golfer of 2016, and currently has a net worth of $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;The total is an incredible sum that he has gleaned from his golfing career and various endorsement deals he has enjoyed over time.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family – mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day’s mother battled lung cancer.&nbsp;She kept it away from her family for a while, but Jason found out and almost gave up his career while taking care of his mother.&nbsp;Thankfully, she underwent successful lung cancer surgery in March 2017 and survived the ordeal.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife and son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jason Day is married to Ellie Harvey.&nbsp;The couple met at a restaurant in Ohio where Elle worked as a waitress and married in 2009.&nbsp;On December 17, 2915, Ellie, wife of Jason Day, was injured during a basketball game when then-Cleveland Cavaliers player LeBron James fell on her while she was sitting in the front row of the court watching the game.&nbsp;She was pulled from the game and hospitalized.</span></p><p><span>Jason and Ellie have two children.&nbsp;A son, Dash, who was born in 2012, and a daughter, Lucy, born in November 2015. The couple lost a baby after Ellie suffered a miscarriage on December 12, 2017.&nbsp;This hasn’t diminished the love Jason Day has for his beautiful wife one bit.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Aussie golfer is 6ft (1.83m) tall which is a good thing as it gives him buoyancy across the field for his long swings, in addition to helping his 88kg weight stabilize his frame.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
