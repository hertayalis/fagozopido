The Flipping Out star announced the separation on January 31 during an episode of his Sirius XM radio show Jeff Lewis Live.</p><p id=par-2_37>The 48-year-old real estate investor and interior designer revealed that Edward had moved out of the couple’s home on Wednesday. Edward is now living in a hotel. Edward and Lewis have a two-year-old daughter named Monroe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did the pair separate?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jeff-lewis-gage-edward-1.jpg><p id=par-3_39>Lewis didn’t reveal a specific reason for the couple’s separation. While Lewis was sharing photos of the two together on Instagram as recently as two days ago, he did say that the break up was “a long time coming.”</p><p id=par-4_25>“We’ve were in separate rooms a significant portion of last year, so it was kind of like a roommate situation,” People magazine <a href=#>quoted Lewis as saying</a>.</p><p id=par-5_54>“I think the reason we hadn’t ripped the Band-Aid off and separated was because, a) we have the baby, and neither one of us want to leave the baby. And then b) financially, it wasn’t the best time because I have four properties right now – three of which are in construction and one of which is sellable.”</p><p id=par-6_38>Lewis went on to say that there was a lack of intimacy in the relationship. While the two were “friends with benefits,” according to the Bravo star, the emotional connection was lacking. More recently, Edward started looking at apartments, Lewis said.</p><p id=par-7_46>Eventually, Lewis said he asked his boyfriend of 10 years to move out so Edward had the time and space he needed to “get perspective.” While the two are not living together at the moment, he said he told Edward, “I’m not breaking up with you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The age gap was a factor</h2><p id=par-8_48>One factor that apparently played a role in Lewis and Edward’s problems was their age gap. Lewis is 10 years older than Edward. He implied that Edward might have felt he missed out on something by getting involved in a serious relationship when still in his 20s.</p><p id=par-9_42>“[When we met] I was in my 30s, he was in his 20s,” Lewis said. “I feel like I went out, I had 10 years of partying and dating and sex and all that. I don’t feel like I was missing anything.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lewis admits he could have worked harder for the relationship</h2><p id=par-10_28>While Lewis said that he was the one to ask Edward to leave, he admits that he did not do all he could to save the relationship.</p><p id=par-11_40>“For many, many, many months I was like, ‘F*** it. It’s happening. We’re breaking up. It’s a matter of time.’ And I didn’t help matters any at all,” Lewis said. “I didn’t fight for the relationship. I didn’t work for the relationship. “</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What will happen to Monroe?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-12_34>Lewis didn’t reveal many details about how the split will affect the couple’s daughter Monroe. At the moment, the toddler is still with Lewis, who referred to himself as a “single dad” during the show.</p><p id=par-13_25>An <a href=#>anonymous source told People</a> that the couple is united in their desire to protect their daughter no matter what happens with their relationship.</p><p id=par-14_41>“They’ve always kept any of the trouble that was going on between them away from her, making it a point not to argue in front of her or around her,” the insider told the magazine. “She’s totally unaware of any tension. They’re great parents.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_53>Lewis and Edward are currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Alexandra Trent, the surrogate who gave birth to Monroe. She sued the couple along with Bravo and the show’s production company, saying that they filmed her during delivery without her permission. The ongoing case is likely to go to trial, according to People.</p><p id=par-16_5>Check out&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;on Facebook!&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzrbXPqaCnn12kwrV51qGwZpyZmXqrscWfZKWdp57Abq3NnWSgmZeaeqaw1pqpnWWSp7Kit4yup2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./clare-pattinson-wiki-husband-net-worth-height-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clare Pattinson- Wiki, Husband, Net Worth, Height, Career">&larr;
