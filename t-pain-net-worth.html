For that, T-Pain received a certificate of Recording Industries Association of America`s Gold.</p><p>T-Pain then released his second album Epiphany in 2007, which managed to sell approximately 170,000 recordings in the first week after release, and reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The most popular singles are considered to be Church, Buy You a Drink along with <a href=#>Yung Joc</a>, and Bartender alongside <a href=#>Akon</a>. T-Pain’s third album Thr33 Rings, released in 2008 sold more than 168,000 copies in its first week after release, and went to #4 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>T-Pain’s fourth album rEVOLVEr was eventually released in December 2011 after considerable angst between T-Pain and contributing artists. A fifth album called Stoicville – the Phoenix is scheduled for release in 2015.</p><p>T-Pain also increased his net worth with the incomes from Nappy Boy Entertainment, a record label company founded by himself.
