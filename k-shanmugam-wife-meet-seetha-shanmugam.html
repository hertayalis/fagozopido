Shanmugam wife-Singaporean politician and lawyer, <a href=#>Shanmugam Kasiviswanathan</a> was born on March 26, 1959.</strong></p><p>From 1972 until 1977, Shanmugam attended Raffles Institution for his education. He continued his legal studies at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Law, where he received his degree in 1984.</p><p>For being the best student from his first to third years and for academic distinction (1982–1983), Shanmugam received numerous accolades, book prizes, and scholarships throughout his stay in law school. Additionally, he was awarded the 1984 Montrose Memorial Prize for Jurisprudence.</p><p>Being the top law student in his graduating class and the top student in the final-year exams earned Shanmugam the Adrian Clarke Memorial Medal, the Leow Chia Heng Prize, and the External Examiner’s Prize in 1984.</p><p>Additionally, in 1984, he participated on behalf of Singapore in the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, where his team finished second in the international division.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03134724/image-82-1024x682.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>K. Shanmugam career</h2><p>Shanmugam entered private practice after being called to the Singapore Bar in 1985 as an advocate and solicitor. He later rose to the position of senior partner and Head of Litigation and Dispute Resolution at Allen & Gledhill.</p><p>At the age of 38, Shanmugam was one of the youngest attorneys to be named Senior Counsel of the Supreme Court in 1998.</p><p>In legal proceedings, Shanmugam has represented Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as well as his predecessors Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.</p><p>After the Lees and Goh filed a civil libel lawsuit against the publication, the International Herald Tribune chose Shanmugam to represent them.</p><p>Lee Kuan Yew later said that the Tribune’s choice of Shanmugam to represent them, despite the fact that he belonged to the People’s Action Party and was close to the Lees and Goh, was the highest compliment to the Senior Counsel’s and the Singapore Government’s overall integrity.</p><p>When he joined the People’s Action Party (PAP) campaign for Sembawang GRC in the 1988 general election, Shanmugam made his political debut.</p><p>The PAP team prevailed, and Shanmugam was elected to represent the Chong Pang ward in the Sembawang GRC as a Member of Parliament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03134705/image-81-1024x537.png><p>Up until 2008, Shanmugam was a member of parliament and a practicing attorney. He then entered the Cabinet to take S. Jayakumar’s place as minister of law.</p><p>In 2010, he succeeded Wong Kan Seng as Minister for Home Affairs after being concurrently named Second Minister for Home Affairs in 2008.</p><p>After the general election in May 2011, Shanmugam gave up his position as minister of home affairs and was instead named minister of foreign affairs. He kept his position as minister of law, though.</p><p>As of 2015, Shanmugam is still serving as the representative for the Chong Pang ward, which is now a part of the Nee Soon GRC.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is K.
